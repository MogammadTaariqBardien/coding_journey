          <p id="about">
            My over coding journey was been a pleasant one. I have learnt alot of life skills, interpersonal skills, communication and much more from being in the course. I have made friends who help me along the way and have helped me grow to be better as an individual. I have learnt to also code which has been been tough but a great experience as I have been challenged and it has allowed me to grow and learn.
